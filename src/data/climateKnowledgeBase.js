  // Climate Change Basics
  climateChange: {
    definition: `Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While some changes are natural, human activities have been the main driver since the 1800s, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas which release greenhouse gases.`,
    globalWarming: `Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's surface. Since 1900, the average global temperature has risen by about 1.1°C. This may seem small, but it causes significant impacts on weather patterns, sea levels, and ecosystems worldwide.`

    },
    {
      question: "What is climate change?",
      answer: "Climate change refers to long-term changes in global temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels since the 1800s."
    },
    {
      question: "What causes climate change?",
      answer: "The main causes are burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas), deforestation, agriculture, industrial processes, and transportation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere."
